# FirewallGuardianToolkit

## Overview
**FirewallGuardianToolkit** is a comprehensive PowerShell script designed to help system administrators manage Windows Firewall logs efficiently for Domain, Private, and Public profiles. This toolkit provides functionalities to configure log folders, retrieve specific log entries, analyze denied connections, and export logs to CSV filesâ€”all from an easy-to-use, menu-driven interface.

## Features

   - Assigns necessary permissions for the Windows Firewall service (`MpsSvc`).

2. **Retrieve Dropped Packets**:
   - Analyzes firewall logs for packets that were dropped in the last specified number of minutes.

3. **Retrieve Allowed Packets**:
   - Analyzes firewall logs for packets that were allowed in the last specified number of minutes.

4. **Export Logs to CSV**:
   - Exports logs for the selected profile to a CSV file with a profile-specific name.

   - Searches the logs for denied connections from a specified source IP.
   - Displays destination ports and traffic types associated with the denied connections.
